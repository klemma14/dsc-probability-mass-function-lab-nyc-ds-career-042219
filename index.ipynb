    "The class size paradox describes apparent contradictory findings where a total allocation of resources is fixed. \n",
    "The idea behind this paradox is that there is a difference in how events are actually distributed and how events are perceived to be distributed. These types of divergence can have important consequences for data analysis. PMFs can help resolve some of these situations as you'll learn below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand and explain the class size paradox \n",
    "* Use PMFs to visualize actual and biased observations\n",
    "* Calculate mean from PMFs to identify the expected value\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "At a university, the expected student-to-teacher ratio is 10:1. But randomly interviewed students often feel that their average class size is much bigger than 10. There are two main reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Students typically take 4 - 5 classes at any given time, but teachers usually only teach 1 or 2 classes.\n",
    "2. The number of students in a small class is small, and the number of students in a large class is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the second fact, while randomly taking feedback from students (and sampling randomly), it is expected to come across _more_ students from larger classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through a set of data to recreate and analyze this paradox. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that a college offers 74 classes in a term. We can start with the following distribution of sizes and counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class size |  Class count |\n",
    "|--------|------|\n",
    "|15-19|\t10|\n",
    "|20-24|\t10|\n",
    "|25-29|\t18|\n",
    "|30-34|\t6|\n",
    "|35-39|\t8|\n",
    "|40-44|\t10|\n",
    "|45-49|\t5|\n",
    "|50-54|\t3|\n",
    "|55-59| 4|\n",
    "\n",
    "If the campus manager is inquired about the average class size, he would perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Construct a PMG from given data\n",
    "2. Compute the mean from calculated PMF\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's follow the management approach first and see what expected value we get from our PMF. Here is a `size_and_count` dictionary to get you started. Calculate the pmf from this data as we have seen before. To make it slightly more straightforward, we have averaged our class sizes for each class, i.e. for size 15 - 19, we use 17 as an average."
